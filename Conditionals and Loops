#1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).

x = int(input())
x / 7 == 0 and x % 5 == 0 and 1500 < x < 2700 

# 2. Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit. [ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ] Expected Output : 60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit and 45°F is 7 in Celsius

c = int(input())
f = c/5 + 32/9 
print (f"{c}C is {f} in Fahrenheit")

# 3. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9. Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

import random 
answer = random.randint (1,10)
guess = 0

while True:
  guess = int(input("Write your number"))
  if guess != answer:
    print ("Your guess is wrong")
  else:
   print ("Your guess is correct!")
   break
   
#4 Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.

for i in range (1,6): 
  print ("*" * i)

for i in range (4):
  print (""*i + "*" * (5-i) + ""*i)

#5 Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.
   
#6 Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers. Sample numbers : numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) Expected Output : Number of even numbers : 5 Number of odd numbers : 4

x = int(input())
for x in range (1,10):
  if x % 2 == 0:
    print ("even number")
  else: 
    print ("odd number")
    
#7 Write a Python program that prints each item and its corresponding type from the following list.

    
#8 Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6. Note : Use 'continue' statement. Expected Output : 0 1 2 4 5

for i in range (0,7):
 if i != 3 and i != 6:
   print (1 * i)
   
#9 Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50. Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, .... Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34


#10 Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

#11 Write a Python program which takes two digits m (row) and n (column) as input and generates a two-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.

#12. Write a Python program that accepts a sequence of lines (blank line to terminate) as input and prints the lines as output (all characters in lower case).

#13. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and print the numbers that are divisible by 5 in a comma separated sequence.Sample Data : 0100,0011,1010,1001,1100,1001 Expected Output : 1010

import random
randNum = random.randInt()

x = int(input())
if () and x%5 == 0:
  print (1010)
  
#14 Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters. Sample Data : Python 3. Expected Output : Letters 6 Digits 2

s = input()

l = 0 
d = 0 

for i in s:
  if i.isletter():
    l=l+1
  else i.isdigit():
    d=d+1

print("letters", l)
print("digits", d)

#15. Write a Python program to check the validity of password input by users. Validation : At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z], At least 1 number between [0-9], At least 1 character from [$#@], Minimum length 6 characters, Maximum length 16 characters.

s = input()

lowerCaseExist = False
upperCaseExist = False
digitExist = False
characterExist = False 


for i in range(len(s)):
  if s[i].islower():
    lowerCaseExist = True
  if s[i].isupper():
    upperCaseExist = True
  if s[i].isdigit():
    digitExist = True
  if s[i].ischaracter():
    characterExist = True

if lowerCaseExist and upperCaseExist and digitExist and 6 < len(s) < 16:
  print("Your password is valid")
else:
  print("Your password is invalid") 


#16. Write a Python program to find numbers between 100 and 400 (both included) where each digit of a number is an even number. The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence.

for x in range (100,401):
  s = str(x)
  isAllEven = True 
  for i in range(len(s)):
    if int[s(i)]%2 != 0:
      isAllEven = False
  if isAllEven:
    print('x',end=',')
